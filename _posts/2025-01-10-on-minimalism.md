Minimalism isn't about having less. It's about making room for what matters.

## The Essence of Design

Good design is as little design as possible. This principle, popularized by Dieter Rams, guides our approach to everything we build.

When you strip away the unnecessary, what remains is essential. The content speaks for itself. The message becomes clear.

## In Practice

For this blog, minimalism means:

1. **Typography first** - Readable fonts at comfortable sizes
2. **Whitespace** - Let content breathe
3. **Simple navigation** - Get out of the reader's way
4. **Focus** - One thing at a time

## The Result

A faster, cleaner, more focused reading experience. No distractions. Just you and the words.

That's what we're building here.

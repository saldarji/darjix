## What I did
Today was a productive day. I worked with Cursor to implement a minimalist theme. It amazes me that it seemingly has an understanding of minimalist design. At one point I tried setting up a Google form instead of a different service, and Cursor commented that it didn't look good with the minimalist theme.

## Changes I made today

+ Applied a minimalist theme
+ Implemented a form using email.js

Welcome to my new site. This is my first post, and I'm excited to share this new journey with the world.

## What am I doing?
I plan on making this the space where I share a lot of my learning as I take on new career challenges. My goal is to provide a useful resource to the world. I also hope to tinker with new AI tools and document my learnings. 

This iteration of the site is being built with Cursor. The stack is Jekyll, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub Pages for hosting.

Thank you for reading.

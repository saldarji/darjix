Welcome to my new site.

## What am I doing?
<!-- This past week I accepted a new position building AI products for higher ed. --> I'll post more on that on LinkedIn. But the most important point is that I will be tinkering with AI tools. I will also be learning more about the way that people learn. As I undertake this new adventure, I will share what I learn here.

## What's the plan?
For the past two years I successfully ran the Boston chapter for AI Tinkerers. I grew it from 1 pizza to 30 pizzas per event, with the help of a team. Despite the success, I am taking a break from running the Boston chapter. And I am also starting to pull back on my extra-curricular activities to focus on something new.

I don't know what the something new is, but AI tools make it easy to tinker, play, and learn. So I approach this without a concrete plan, but with the idea that I'll be building something for me and to fuel my interests.

## Tech stack
This iteration of the site is being built with Cursor. The stack is Jekyll, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub Pages for hosting.

Thank you for reading.

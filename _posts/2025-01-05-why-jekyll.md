Static site generators are having a moment, and for good reason. Let's talk about why we chose Jekyll for Darjix.

## Speed

Static sites are fast. No database queries, no server-side rendering. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript served instantly.

This blog loads in milliseconds. Try refreshing the page. Notice how fast it is?

## Simplicity

Jekyll takes markdown files and turns them into a website. That's it. No complex frameworks, no heavy dependencies.

Write in markdown. Push to GitHub. Done.

## Security

No server means no server vulnerabilities. No database means no SQL injection. Static sites are inherently more secure.

## Cost

GitHub Pages hosts Jekyll sites for free. Zero hosting costs. Zero maintenance overhead.

## Focus

With Jekyll, we can focus on writing. Not configuring. Not debugging. Not updating plugins.

Just writing.

And that's exactly what we want.

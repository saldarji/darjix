Welcome to Darjix, a minimalist blog built with Jekyll and Tailwind CSS. This is our first post, and we're excited to share our thoughts with you.

## What is Darjix?

Darjix is a clean, minimalist blog platform designed for clear thinking and focused writing. We believe in the power of simplicity and the importance of content over decoration.

## Our Philosophy

We've stripped away all the unnecessary elements:

- No shadows or 3D effects
- No colorful gradients
- No distracting animations
- Just pure, focused content

## What's Next?

We'll be sharing articles about design, development, and the art of simplicity. Stay tuned for more updates.

Thank you for reading.
